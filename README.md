# Collaborative Whiteboard App

## Overview

This project is a full-stack, real-time collaborative whiteboard application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Socket.IO. It enables multiple users to join a room, draw together on a shared canvas, and see each other's changes instantly. The app features role-based access (host/presenter vs. participant), modern UI/UX, and robust real-time synchronization.

## Features
- **Real-time collaborative drawing** (pencil, line, rectangle)
- **Undo/Redo** and **Clear Canvas**
- **Color picker** and tool selection
- **Role-based access:** Only the host/presenter can draw and control the whiteboard
- **User list sidebar** with live user count and animated toggle
- **Responsive, modern UI** with Bootstrap and custom CSS
- **Toast notifications** for user join/leave events, styled to match the app theme
- **Room creation/joining** with unique IDs
- **Socket.IO-powered instant updates**
- **WCAG-compliant accessibility**

---

## Architecture

**Frontend:**
- Built with React (Vite for fast dev/build)
- Uses functional components and hooks
- State management is local (per component) with props for integration
- Socket.IO client for real-time events
- Bootstrap and custom CSS for styling

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express server
- Socket.IO server for real-time communication
- In-memory user/session management (no DB persistence in current version)
- Modular user management utilities

**Data Flow:**
- Users join a room (host or participant)
- Presenterâ€™s drawing actions are sent as JSON (not images) to the server
- Server broadcasts drawing actions to all participants in the room
- User join/leave events update the user list and trigger toast notifications

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Bootstrap, roughjs, react-toastify, socket.io-client
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- **Other:** ESLint, Prettier, custom CSS

## Usage

1. **Create or join a room** from the landing page
2. **Share the room ID** with others to collaborate
3. **Host/presenter** can draw, undo/redo, clear, and control the whiteboard
4. **Participants** see a live view and user list, but cannot draw
5. **User list** can be toggled from the floating button
6. **Toast notifications** appear for user join/leave events

---

## Key Components

- **Forms:** Room creation/joining UI
- **Whiteboard:** Canvas drawing, tool/color selection, undo/redo, real-time sync
- **RoomPage:** Main collaboration page, user list, controls, and integration
- **UserBar:** Sidebar for user list (animated, styled)

---

## Real-Time Collaboration

- Uses Socket.IO for low-latency, bi-directional communication
- Presenter emits drawing actions as JSON; server broadcasts to all room members
- User join/leave events update all clients instantly

---

## Role-Based Access

- **Host/Presenter:** Can draw, undo/redo, clear, and control the whiteboard
- **Participants:** View-only; see live updates and user list
- Role is set at room creation/join and enforced in UI and logic

---

## UI/UX & Accessibility

- Modern, minimal, and responsive design
- Bootstrap grid and custom CSS for layout
- Accessible color contrast and keyboard navigation
- Toast notifications styled to match app theme
- Animated sidebar and buttons for user list

---

## Testing

- Manual testing for all features and edge cases
- Linting with ESLint and Prettier
- TODO: Add automated unit and integration tests

---

## Security & Best Practices

- Input validation on forms
- No sensitive data stored client-side
- Socket events validated on server
- No hardcoded secrets in repo
- TODO: Add authentication and persistent storage

---

## Known Issues & TODOs

- No persistent storage (users and whiteboard state are in-memory)
- No authentication (anyone with room ID can join)
- No mobile drawing support (touch events)
- Add more drawing tools (ellipse, text, etc.)
- Add export/download whiteboard as image
- Add automated tests
